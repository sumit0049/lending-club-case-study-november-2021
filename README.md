# Lending Club Case Study
> This assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## Business Objectives
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
-If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).


## Conclusions
- Performance of grading system is robust and it strict adherence to grading parameters is prescribed for
minimising chances of loan default and it is one of the best tool to avoid losses.
- Although loan sanctions have increased dramatically over the years, charged off loan ratio is not trending
upward which implies business expansion to more clients and guideline oriented aggressive loan sanction can
help in increasing profits.
- Location factors do influence loan default and Nebraska has significant loan default risk which implies stringent
loan approval process needs to be in place for this state.
- Customers with 10+ years experience, belonging to small businesses and loans of 60 months tenure are
identified as risky categories which requires improved vigilance and approval measures in place
- Investors should not put too much emphasis on grading as median profits are same across all grades implying
case to case need based loans are need of time and no consumer section should be deprived of loans without
proper follow up.
